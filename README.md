# NengoPRIMs

These files contain a Nengo model that models a mind wandering experiment by Smallwood et al. based on the principles
of PRIMs.

There are two Jupyter notebooks, one that runs on the CPU, and one of the GPU. The GPU version may
need some tweaking to run on your own machine. An R script is supplied to generate the graphs from the paper.
